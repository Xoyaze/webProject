            <p>I've been learning to build websites for quite some time now. Excited to learn more everyday, I keep on searching ways to improve this website too and try to implement them.</p>
            <p>To build a basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've learned quite a few things! First things first, you need to plan out what you want your website to look like and its purpose. Once you have an idea in mind, you can start creating the HTML structure. This includes the basic HTML structure, like the head, body, and doctype. From there, you can create the main sections of your website, like the header, navigation, main content, and footer.</p>

            <p>Now, to make website look visually appealing, style it with CSS. Add colors, fonts, and layout to make the website look professional. Use CSS to create a consistent style throughout the website.</p>
        
            <P>Next, Incorporating JavaScript to add interactive elements, such as pop-up windows, menus, and animations. JavaScript also enables you to add basic functionality to your website, like a contact form or a search bar.</P>
        
            <P>Remembering to test your website frequently as you build it is really important to make sure everything is working as intended. Once happy with your website, it's time to publish it on the internet for the world to see!</p>
