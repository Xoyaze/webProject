            <h1>Web Projects</h1>
            <p>I've been learning to build websites for quite some time now. Excited to learn more everyday, I keep on searching ways to improve this website too and try to implement them.</p>
            <p>To build a basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've learned quite a few things! First things first, you need to plan out what you want your website to look like and its purpose. Once you have an idea in mind, you can start creating the HTML structure. This includes the basic HTML structure, like the head, body, and doctype. From there, you can create the main sections of your website, like the header, navigation, main content, and footer.</p>

            <p>To make website look visually appealing, style it with CSS. Add colors, fonts, and layout to make the website look professional. Use CSS to create a consistent style throughout the website.</p>
        
            <P>Next, Incorporating JavaScript to add interactive elements, such as pop-up windows, menus, and animations. JavaScript also enables you to add basic functionality to your website, like a contact form or a search bar.</P>
        
            <P>Remembering to test your website frequently as you build it is really important to make sure everything is working as intended. Once happy with your website, it's time to publish it on the internet for the world to see!</p>

            <h1>Blender Projects</h1>
            <p>Learning blender, for me, is really very fun thing to do. I don't have a good device but it can manage some of it.</p>
            <p>To build this specific doughnut in blender, I first started with a torus mesh and used the subdivision surface modifier to make it seem more like a doughnut, added some loop cuts, duplicated the upper half to make the icing part, used geometry nodes to make the sprinkles and then finally moved to coloring and texturing it.</p>
            <p>To texture the doughnut, I first used some basic color,roughness, and other setup in the principled BSDF. I then used the roughness texture to make it look more realistic. Using the uv editor got some more detail out of it.</p>
            <p>Moving on directly to animation, I only used the rotation keyframe to animate the doughnut. The animation is pretty simple without any camera movements and also without any location keyframe.</p>
            <p>After that I did some compositing to add some glow and background color to the doughnut animation.</p>
            <p>Finally, rendered the animation and here it is.</p>
