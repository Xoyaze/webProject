            <h3>I love stars!</h3>
            <p>I'm quite a fan of stars, often find myself looking at them, well when I'm out of valley at least cause it's not that visible inside the valley.These are some of the pictures I took while I was out, took it with my smartphone actually. Am not a photographer but I think I managed to take some good shots of it.</p>
            
            <p>These stars, so far away, looks beautiful in the nightsky, but imagining them right where our sun is... sends shivers down my spine. Gosh, I love space!</p>

        <h3>About this website!</h3>
        <p>This website is on progress...</p>
        <p>I've been learning about websites since I was a kid. Did some html when I was maybe in the 6th grade, never been confident though. Although I had some idea on how a typical website works or how it is actually built, I never knew how to build one for myself. I found out, how you can have free webhosting and a free domain name as well through a program hosted by my college. I then started learning HTML first and then CSS, watched alot of videos on youtube, read codes online trying to learn them and understand how they work, downloaded some of demo website codes to know how people build websites and learn from it by changing, removing, or adding stuffs. But whatever I did, never learned more from anywhere other than <a style="color: white; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU">youtube. </a></p>
        <p>Althogh it may look neat, this website, I find it challenging to work on building seemlessly responsive websites. There are multiple ideas and lessons I yet need to learn, but I am happy with what I can build. I am not stoping though, I know I've just started this and I'm happy to learn more and more everday.</p>
