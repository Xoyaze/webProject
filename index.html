                <h3>Love Stars!</h3>
                <p>I'm a fan of stars, often find myself looking at them. Well, when I'm out of valley at least cause it's not that visible inside the valley.These are some of the pictures I took while I was out, took it with my smartphone actually. Not a photographer but I think I managed to take some good shots of it.</p>
                
                <p>Stars that are light years away from us could actually be in a completely different state than how we see them now because we only see the light that left them years and years ago.</p>
    
                <p>UY Scuti, a star that's about 9500 lightyears away from us takes about 9500 years for the light from there to reach us here, which means we see the UY Scuti how it was about 9500 years ago.</p>
    
                <p>Imagine UY Scuti sitting right where the sun is. It is 1700 times larger than our sun. It would reach jupiter just sitting where our sun is. Love space.</p>

        <h3>About this website!</h3>
        <p>This website is on progress...</p>
        <p>I've been learning about websites since I was a kid. Did some html when I was maybe in the 6th grade, never been confident though. I had some idea on how a typical website works or how it is actually built but I didn't know how to build one for myself. I found out, how you can have free webhosting and a free domain name as well through a program hosted by my college. I then started learning HTML first and then CSS, watched alot of videos on youtube, read codes online trying to learn them and understand how they work, downloaded some of demo website codes to know how people build websites and learn from it by changing, removing, or adding stuffs. But whatever I did, never learned more from anywhere other than <a style="color: white; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU">youtube. </a></p>
        <p>Although it may look neat, this website, I find it challenging to work on building seemlessly responsive websites. There are multiple ideas and lessons I yet need to learn, but I am happy with what I can build. I am not stoping though, I know I've just started this and I'm happy to learn more and more everday.</p>
